**WeatherApp** is a simple single page app featuring the current weather and forecasts

WeatherApp is a single-page iOS app that uses the [openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display the current weather, hourly weather, and daily forecast for the next days.

During the development of this app, I focused on the creation of custom UI elements in both UIKit and SwiftUI and the interoperability between these two frameworks.

Another focus point was the exercise in data transformation of the fidly JSON response into structured data that is more suitable to display in a UI app.
